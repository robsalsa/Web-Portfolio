To keep this short and simple this is a Web Portfolio. The purpose of making this is because I wanted to beef up my Resume.



Thing it will have: 
    Written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
    Resume (Link or Page), Github (Link), and LinkedIn (Link).
    Have some images of some projects (either a preview page or a .png/.jpg, or github link of just the project)
    Some personally made images to add some life into this thing (OPTIONAL)
    
    The Usual Things in a Resume: 
        +contact me
        +summary of me
        +skills
        +feedback (just in case there is a critical error in the program or tech)



Functions needed for any HTML: 
    +index.html == HTML
    +script.js == Javascript
    +style.css == C#
    -Assets
        +about-img.png
        +header-img.png
        +logo.png (OPTIONAL but here is going to be my personalized image)

The Point of the Index: 
    This is where the magority of visable code will be found. What I mean by this is what you can see while writing code.

The Point of the Script: 
    Allows for the use of the openMenu() function. This means that the nav functions that you'll see in my code will be unlocked. 

The Point of the Style: 
    ass the name implies this is going to be a long check list ranging from the font, size, and other things that would stylize the pages.
